Time accelerates infinitely towards a Singularity, the universe collapses into a point at that instant, and a new universe forms after another Big Bang. (The difference is that all surviving beings from the previous world return to the new world, while beings who died during the acceleration are replaced by not-quite-identical counterparts from different spacetimes.) This is 「Heaven」.$()$(br)$()$(br)The power of the Infinite Universe Star is immense, but still insufficient to accelerate the entire universe—but, if it's just accelerating yourself, it is enough."
